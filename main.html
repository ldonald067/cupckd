    <h2>About founder</h2>
    <p>Candace Nelson is the founder and pastry chef of Sprinkles Cupcakes, the world's first cupcake bakery. Started in Beverly Hills in 2005, Candace's sophisticated take on the classic American cupcake made Sprinkles an overnight bakery sensation. Candace's cupcakes, made from the best ingredients and baked fresh throughout the day, inspire long lines of devoted fans as well as accolades from the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Blake Lively, Katie Holmes, <strong class="flashy">Ryan Seacrest and Barbra Streisand</strong>. Today, Sprinkles has 22 locations nationwide, a traveling Sprinklesmobile – the world's first cupcake truck, and sells its cupcake mixes at over 250 Williams-Sonoma stores throughout the U.S. and Canada. In 2012, Sprinkles debuted the world's first Cupcake ATM and continued its foray into classic American desserts with the launch of Sprinkles Ice Cream. Future expansion plans include a franchise agreement that will bring 34 Sprinkles Cupcakes bakeries to the Middle East beginning in 2013.
Candace, a former investment banker, is a graduate of Tante Marie's Professional Pastry Program in San Francisco and Wesleyan University. Candace is a dedicated philanthropist, an angel supporter of Baby2Baby and a board member of LAXart.
